# Gamebook Conversion Example

So I'm working on a series of blog posts about how to convert a gamebook from a printed book to a playable HTML game, using [Tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/) and related tools. The blog posts will be posted [on my blog](https://uselessofblog.blogspot.com/). You'll probably need a Unix-family machine to follow along fully. It's not that I'm *trying* to do things that aren't Windows-compatible, but I don't own a Windows development machine. I therefore can't test anything on Windows, so I'm going to have to say that YMMV.

I plan to update this repo in sync with the blog posts. I am going to try and organise the repo so that there'll be a release here for each post on the blog, so you can see how they link up.

Watch this space - and also [this space](https://uselessofblog.blogspot.com/).
